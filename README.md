A simple balcony gardening app made for Software Development: Mobile course. The goal was to make a simple Android app independently.

The main purpose of the app is that the user is able to enter some simple data about the plants in their garden. ðŸŒ±

Future development ideas would be that the app would set alerts on the phone when it would be expected that the plants need to be watered or harvested, and handling data storage so that it keeps the information on closing the app. The app is still in the beginning stages.
