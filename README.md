# mobile_course

A simple balcony gardening app made for Software Development: Mobile course. The project was started following simple tutorials, and the goal was to make a simple app independently.

The goal of the app is that the user would be able to enter some simple data about the plants in their garden, and the app would alert them when it would be expected that they need to be watered or harvested. The app is still in the beginning stages.
